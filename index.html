    Welcome to the Landing Zone of Andrew Waddell. Veteran and Student of University of Advancing Technology!

    Below is a short bio about myself.
    </h2>
    <br>
    I have been a memeber of the United States Air Force for 13 years.
    <br>
    I started out as an Aircraft Armament Systems Technician. Or "Weapons Loader and Maintainer" for short.
    <br>
    I have had the pleasure of working on the fifth generation F-22A Raptor. As well as the F-16C Fighting Falcon
    <br>
    and the Remotely Piloted Aircraft the MQ-9 Reaper.
    <br>
    After a 10 year career doing that I retrained into Cyber Based Intelligence for the Air National Guard of Washington State.
    <br>
    Then I most recently retrained again to become and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician. Which I currently do now at Nellis AFB, NV.
    <br>
    I have had the pleasure of traveling all over the world during my time to include Korea, Japan, and Kuwait.
    <br>
    I am currently enrolled full time at the University of Advancing Technology studying Artifical Intelligence.
    <br>
    I enjoy being outdoors most of time. I like to camp, hunt, and fish.
    <br>
    I have also recently starting learning to speak Norwegian after finding out about my Norse heritage.
