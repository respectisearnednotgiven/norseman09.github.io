    Artificial Intelligence Objectives for UAT
</h1>
<h2>
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) explores the theory and development of tools that simulate thinking, patterning and advanced
decision behaviors by software running on computing 
devices. AI applications are able to solve and navigate complex
scenarios that require drawing inferences appropriate to situations, performing decision-making using complex and changing
data, discovering meaning, generalizing conclusions based upon learned events and from experience. AI approaches within
software form the underpinnings of autonomous devices, such as self-driving vehicles and drones. Technologies such as big
data analysis, voice recognition, simulation agents and IoT devices all require AI algorithms. UAT studies in AI cover
fundamentals of general and applied artificial intelligence including core programming languages and platforms used in
computer science. Advanced coursework encompasses applying principles of natural language processing, machine learning,
behavior simulation and deep learning based upon big data sets. Students prepare for future-oriented AI uses by applying
computer science approaches and AI concepts as they develop solutions to real-world projects within production studio
settings.
